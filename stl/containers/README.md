- Containers or container classes store objects and data. 
- There are in total seven standard “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.

__definitions__

    Sequence Containers                 implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.
    Container Adaptors                  provide a different interface for sequential containers.
    Associative Containers              implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
    Unordered Associative Containers    implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched
